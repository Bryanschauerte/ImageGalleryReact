This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Its pretty handy if you just want to GO, without having to worry about your webpack, jspm or yarn configs.


ImageGalleryReact contains the peices to a catalog I built to meet someones needs. Nothing too fancy, just pulls in urls from certain galleries, and displays them without any fuss on sizes.
